# Electricity Consumption Analysis
Data analysis of electricity consumption is crucial for day-to-day life, providing insights, supporting decision-making, and fostering improvements in households and organizations. This study focuses on the analysis of electricity consumption data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can contribute to future consumption and cost reduction.

## Overview
The project involves several key steps:
1. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Cluster electricity consumption data to identify distinct usage patterns.
   - Group similar consumption profiles together for deeper insights.

2. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - Employ time series forecasting models to predict future electricity consumption and associated costs.
   - Use historical data for accurate predictions to optimize resource allocation and plan for efficient energy generation and distribution.

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Apply PCA to identify key factors influencing electricity consumption and costs.
   - Reduce dimensionality for a more concise representation of variables contributing significantly to overall variability.
